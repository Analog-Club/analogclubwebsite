# Getting Started with Flask

The back-end is constructed with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/).

## Available Scripts

Be sure to move to the correct directories via cd commands in the terminal.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `---app` option

Is used to define what file to import.
Defaults to an app (app or application) or factory (create_app or make_app).

Ex. `flask --app cool_file_name run` (if you want to run a file not named "app")

### `flask run`

Runs the app in the development mode.
The link to the Flask App will print in the terminal.
